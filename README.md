For all the data, it is important to understand the following terms if present:

Increment Time: This corresponds to the time increment along the x-axis, as exported from the oscilloscope. It is correlated with the oscilloscope’s division settings.

Conversion Factor (Value in V/µA): This represents the sensitivity of the preamplifier. It is used to convert the voltage  𝑉(𝑖)obtained from the oscilloscope into current by applying this factor. As a result, current measurements always include an additional column that displays the actual current values after applying the conversion factor.

For humidity data, since it consists of a large dataset, the sensitivity has already been applied with values of 20 or 50 V/µA, depending on the dataset.
